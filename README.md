# Modmode
A Minecraft Plugin that gives Moderators the ability to keep change own inventory for playing and moderating on a Survival Server.

## How it works
The player, when they are playing normally, has their normal inventory. But when they are moderating (aka. in `Modmode`) they can have a different inventory
so that they don't override these items.
